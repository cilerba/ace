# Pokémon ACE Scripts
Collection of ACE scripts for Pokémon games by collaborators of the repo. (Currently only available for ENG Pokémon Red and Blue)

These are intended to be used with [TimoVM's RAM Writer (TimOS)](https://glitchcity.wiki/wiki/Guides:Nickname_Writer_Codes#Installing_a_RAM_writer_environment_(TimOS)) after [setting up the SRAM Glitch](https://glitchcity.wiki/wiki/Guides:TimoVM%27s_gen_1_ACE_setups) in your Generation I game.

## Installation
More details on installation will be provided at a later date (along with additional scripts).<br>
For now, please use a save backup tool like GBxCart or GB Operator to write the pre-made Shiny Indicator save file to your cart.

## Notes
TimoVM's Nickname Writer and RAM Writer both take up free space in the daycare and inventory. Using the daycare will break the ACE setup. The inventory is also limited to 5 available slots.

### RB - ShinyIndicator & MSPHijackInstaller
Code for the MSPHijackInstaller lives in slots 19 and 20 in the currently loaded box. At this time, please avoid switching boxes and filling the current loaded box past the 18th slot while I try to optimize this setup.

<strong>Do not use save editing tools like PKHeX! This will break the shiny indicator and potentially damage the entire ACE setup.</strong>

Please let any of us know of any issues that you may encounter with these scripts!
